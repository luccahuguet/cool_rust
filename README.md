## What is Cool-Rust?
The following are great programs written in rust that I have used, that are also popular, mantained and blazingly fast.   

What does this list bring to the table, in comparison to other rust-projects-lists?  
It is short and it will be continuously updated, for I am a true rustacean. :crab:


### Text Editors / IDEs
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) - A post-modern modal text editor for the terminal, inspired by neovim and kakoune, but with much less configuration needed. Blazingly fast!
- [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) - Lapce is written in pure Rust with a UI in Druid (also written in Rust)
 It is designed with Rope Science from the Xi-Editor which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages OpenGL for rendering
- [zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) - Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. (did I mention written in rust?)

### Terminal-related
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell! Cross-platform
- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) - a new type of shell. Cross-platform. Shows every output as a table. Understands json, yaml and others. Autocompletion out of the box 
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator
- [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) - A terminal workspace with batteries included, great for multiplexing
- Trivia: The 4 above projecs form what I call the SNAZ terminal stack

### CLI Tools - Data summarizers & monitors
- [erdtree](https://github.com/solidiquis/erdtree) - A modern, vibrant (but not overly), and multi-threaded file-tree visualizer and disk usage
analyzer that respects hidden files and .gitignore rules - basically if tree and du had a baby. 
- [cargo-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update) - A cargo subcommand for checking and applying updates to installed executables

### Git - Version control
- [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) -  An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git 
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) - GitUI provides you with the comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal

### CLI Tools
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - a cat clone with wings. Syntax highlighting for the win

### Operating Systems / Desktop Environments
- [COSMIC DE](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch) - A brand new Desktop Environment for linux, written in Rust by the System76 team (great company), and a great alternative to KDE and Gnome. It features uniform theming across new cosmic-based applications: cosmic-files, cosmic-term, cosmic-text-editor, cosmic-store. Very fast, customizable, and with a really great window manager
- [redox-os](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) - Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.

### Other Honorable Mentions
- [ouch](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) - It's a CLI tool for compressing and decompressing for various formats. Easy to use. Fast. Great error message feedback.
No runtime dependencies required (for Linux x86_64). Accessibility mode. Shell completions and man pages.  
- [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch) - Git repository summary on your terminal, a neofecth for git projects. Will count lines of code and separe per language!
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - Yet another cross-platform graphical process/system monitor
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Just a command runner. Similar to make, but simpler and modern
- [rusty-rain](https://github.com/cowboy8625/rusty-rain) - A cross platform matrix rain made with Rust.
