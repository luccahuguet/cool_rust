## What is Cool Rust ?
The following are great programs written in rust that I have used, that are also popular, mantained and blazingly fast.
Stars are given to projects that feel special and of great use, those are the ones you should try out!

### Shells
- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) :star: - a new type of shell. Cross-platform. Shows every output as a table. Understands json, yaml and others. Autocompletion out of the box 

### Text Editors / IDEs
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) :star: - A post-modern modal text editor, inspired by neovim and kakoune, but with much less configuration needed. Blazingly fast!
- [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) - Lapce is written in pure Rust with a UI in Druid (also written in Rust)
 It is designed with Rope Science from the Xi-Editor which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages OpenGL for rendering

### Terminal
- [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) :star: - A terminal workspace with batteries included, great for multiplexing
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) :star: - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell! Cross-platform
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) :star: - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator

### CLI Tools - Data summarizers & monitors
- [erdtree](https://github.com/solidiquis/erdtree) :star: - A modern, vibrant (but not overly), and multi-threaded file-tree visualizer and disk usage
analyzer that respects hidden files and .gitignore rules - basically if tree and du had a baby. (fun fact: the binary that was called erdtree is now called et because
I suggested so to the author on reddit)
- [ouch](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) - It's a CLI tool for compressing and decompressing for various formats. Easy to use. Fast. Great error message feedback.
No runtime dependencies required (for Linux x86_64). Accessibility mode. Shell completions and man pages. Written in rustðŸ¦€! 
- [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch) - Git repository summary on your terminal, a neofecth for git projects. Will count lines of code and separe per language!
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - Yet another cross-platform graphical process/system monitor
- [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs) - procs is a replacement for ps written in Rust

### Git - Version control
- [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) :star: -  An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git 
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) :star: - GitUI provides you with the comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal

### CLI Tools
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) :star: - a cat clone with wings. Syntax highlighting for the win
- [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) - Cross-platform Rust rewrite of the GNU coreutils
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Just a command runner. Similar to make, but simpler

### Operating Systems
- [redox-os](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox)  :star: - A Rust Operating System
