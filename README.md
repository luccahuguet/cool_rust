## What is Cool Rust ?
The following are great programs written in rust that I have used, that are also popular, mantained and blazingly fast.  
Stars are given to projects that feel special and of great use, those are the ones you should try out!
What this list in detriment of other lists? Because it is short and because it will continuously be updated, for I am a true rustacean.


### Text Editors / IDEs
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) :star: - A post-modern modal text editor, inspired by neovim and kakoune, but with much less configuration needed. Blazingly fast!
- [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) - Lapce is written in pure Rust with a UI in Druid (also written in Rust)
 It is designed with Rope Science from the Xi-Editor which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages OpenGL for rendering

### Terminal-related
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) :star: - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell! Cross-platform
- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) :star: - a new type of shell. Cross-platform. Shows every output as a table. Understands json, yaml and others. Autocompletion out of the box 
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) :star: - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator
- [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) :star: - A terminal workspace with batteries included, great for multiplexing
- Trivia: The 4 above projecs form what I call the SNAZ terminal stack

### CLI Tools - Data summarizers & monitors
- [erdtree](https://github.com/solidiquis/erdtree) :star: - A modern, vibrant (but not overly), and multi-threaded file-tree visualizer and disk usage
analyzer that respects hidden files and .gitignore rules - basically if tree and du had a baby. (fun fact: the binary that was called erdtree is now called et because
I suggested so to the author on reddit)
- [ouch](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) - It's a CLI tool for compressing and decompressing for various formats. Easy to use. Fast. Great error message feedback.
No runtime dependencies required (for Linux x86_64). Accessibility mode. Shell completions and man pages. Written in rustðŸ¦€! 
- [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch) - Git repository summary on your terminal, a neofecth for git projects. Will count lines of code and separe per language!
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - Yet another cross-platform graphical process/system monitor
- [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs) - procs is a replacement for ps written in Rust

### Git - Version control
- [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) :star: -  An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git 
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) :star: - GitUI provides you with the comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal

### CLI Tools
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) :star: - a cat clone with wings. Syntax highlighting for the win
- [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) - Cross-platform Rust rewrite of the GNU coreutils
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Just a command runner. Similar to make, but simpler

### Operating Systems
- [redox-os](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox)  :star: - Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust, aiming to bring the innovations of Rust to a modern microkernel and full set of applications.
