## What is Cool Rust ?
The following are great programs written in rust that I have used, that are also popular, mantained and blazingly fast!

### Shells
- [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) - a new type of shell. Cross-platform. Shows every output as a table. Understands json, yaml and others. Autocompletion out of the box :star:

### Editors
- [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) :star: - A post-modern modal text editor, inspired by neovim and kakoune, but with much less configuration needed. Blazingly fast!
- [lapce](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) - Lapce is written in pure Rust with a UI in Druid (also written in Rust)
 It is designed with Rope Science from the Xi-Editor which makes for lightning-fast computation, and leverages OpenGL for rendering

### CLI Tools - Data summarizers & monitors
- [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) :star: - du + rust = dust. Like du but more intuitive. Because you want an easy way to see where your disk is being used. 
- [bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - Yet another cross-platform graphical process/system monitor
- [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) - Counts the number of files, total lines within those files and code, comments, and blanks grouped by language :star:
- [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs) - procs is a replacement for ps written in Rust
- [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch) - Git repository summary on your terminal

### CLI Tools
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) :star: - a cat clone with wings. Syntax highlighting for the win
- [coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) :star: - Cross-platform Rust rewrite of the GNU coreutils
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - recursively searches directories for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore

### Terminal
- [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) :star: - A terminal workspace with batteries included, great for multiplexing
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) :star: - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell! Cross-platform
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) :star: - A cross-platform, OpenGL terminal emulator

### File Traversers / Fuzzy searching
- [xplr](https://github.com/sayanarijit/xplr) - A hackable, minimal fast TUI file explorer
- [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) - A new way to see and navigate directory trees

### Git - Version control
- [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide) :star: -  An idiomatic, lean, fast & safe pure Rust implementation of Git 
- [gitui](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui) :star: - GitUI provides you with the comfort of a git GUI but right in your terminal

### Plan to use in the future
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Just a command runner. Similar to make, but simpler
- [meilisearch](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch) -  A lightning-fast search engine that fits effortlessly into your apps, websites, and workflow
- [redox-os](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) - A Rust Operating System
